## Workflow

Project roughly follows the process described in [this guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/), with the following additions:

- When you start working on an issue, assign yourself to it. You don't have permissions to do that, comment to the issue that you're working on it.
- When creating a pull request, please add words "Connects to #0", replacing #0 with the relevant issue ID, to the pull request description. This [connects the pull request](https://github.com/waffleio/waffle.io/wiki/FAQs#prs-connect-keywords) to the relevant issue in our [waffle board](https://waffle.io/thesoftwarefactory/lokki).
- After making a pull request, you might want to be proactive and try to get someone to review and possibly merge it.
- We're using Continuous Integration, make sure the PR passes on Travis before merging.
